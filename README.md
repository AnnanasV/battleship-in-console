You need a friend to play. Both of you have to go to run "battleship.exe" and choose "1" in menu to create fields.
You can`t set ships so close, even obliquely.

GO:
right - right arrow
left - left arrow
down - down arrow
up - up arrow
turn around - spacebar

After successful finishing a program will write, that file has already been created.


 P L A Y I N G - W I T H - F R I E N D


If you and your friend created fields, then choose "2" in main menu.
Both of files must be in the same folder as "battleship.exe".

You need to enter the same data that you entered when creating the field. If you don`t remember, you can see it in the title.
"[name]_PlayerField[number].exe"

If you hit the ship, the cell turns YELLOW, if you killed, the cell turns RED. If you don't hit, the cell turns GRAY.
(remember that ships cannot stand too close to each other, program will turn gray cells which cannot contain a ship)

After playing program will ask you to delete used files. You can write "Yes" or "y",
or delete this files in menu with "3".


 D E L E T E - U N N E C E S S A R Y - F I L E S


In menu "3" just enter the same data that you entered when creating the field.
Your field will be deleted and program will write you about this.
